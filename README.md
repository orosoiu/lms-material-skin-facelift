# lms-material-skin-facelift

Light facelift of Logitech Media Server's Material Skin to make it more palatable:
- round artist images
- rounded borders on album images
- custom font
- increase font size in portrait modes for better readability
- added some spacing on queue images to improve readability
- custom color schemes

The changes work best with the dark theme.
